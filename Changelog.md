## 2.4.0
- Fix [StrayQuoteError](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.StrayQuoteError.html) not getting 
  passed the correct arguments in strict mode. [Fixes #96](https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv/issues/96).
- When headers are present multiple times and the `:headers` option is set to `true`, parse the values into a list.

## 2.3.1
- Fix [StrayQuoteError](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.StrayQuoteError.html) incorrectly 
  getting raised when escape sequences end in new lines. [Fixes #89](https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv/issues/89).
  Raised by [@rockwood](https://github.com/rockwood) in [Issue #96](https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv/issues/96).

## 2.3.0
- Add [StrayQuoteError](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.StrayQuoteError.html) which gets 
  raised when a row has stray quotes rather than [EscapeSequenceError](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.EscapeSequenceError.html#content) 
  to help with common encoding errors.

## 2.2.0
- Make syntax compatible with latest Elixir releases
- Add [`validate_row_length:` option](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.html#decode/2-options) defaulting to true to allow 
  disabling validation of row length.

## 2.0.0
- Make [`decode`](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.html#decode/2) return row and
  error tuples instead of raising errors directly
- Make old behaviour of raising errors directly available
  via [`decode!`](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.html#decode!/2)
- Improve error messages for escape sequences
- Rewrite parts of the pipeline to be more modular

## 1.4.4
- Load [`parallel_stream`](https://github.com/beatrichartz/parallel_stream)
  as an app dependency to avoid load level errors.
  See [issue #56](https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv/issues/56) reported
  by [@luk3thomas](https://github.com/luk3thomas)

## 1.4.3
- Fix a case where lines would not be aggregated correctly
  [see #52](https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv/issues/52) reported by 
  [@yury-dimov](https://github.com/yury-dymov)

## 1.4.2
- Update dependency on [`parallel_stream`](https://github.com/beatrichartz/parallel_stream)

## 1.4.1
- Fix condition where rows would be dropped when decoding from stateful streams.
  [See #39](https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv/issues/39) reported by
  [@moxley](https://github.com/moxley)

## 1.4.0

- add option to specify headers in encode - added [in #34](https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv/issues/34)
  by [@barruumrex](https://github.com/barruumrex)

## 1.3.3

- Fix empty streams raising a lexer error - raised [in #28](https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv/issues/28)
  by [@kiliancs](https://github.com/kiliancs)

## 1.3.2

- Cleanup, removing some unused defaults in function headers to remove compile
  time warnings

## 1.3.1

- Fix `:strip_cells` not stripping cells when multible options are specified - #29 by [@tomjoro](https://github.com/tomjoro)

## 1.3.0

- Now supports linebreaks inside escaped fields (#13)
- Raises an error when row length mismatches accross rows
- Uses [parallel_stream](https://github.com/beatrichartz/parallel_stream) for parallelism

## 1.2.4

- Test utf-8 files with BOM
- Syntax and mix updates for elixir 1.2

## 1.2.1

  results due to leftover state in decoder message queue

## 1.1.1

  in case of failure
