# Changelog

## 3.0.1 (2022-10-25)
- Ensure that stray escape quotes and unterminated escape sequences on a last line without a newline produce errors

## 3.0.0 (2022-10-25)
- The parallel parser/lexer with a binary matching parser with better performance.
- A new `:field_transform` option allows specifying functionality applied when decoding any field through a function
- Escape characters can now be specified using the `:escape_character` option, this [Closes #59](https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv/issues/59)
- The library will now reparse lines that follow e.g. an unterminated escape sequence. This ensures that all possible valid rows
  will be returned in normal mode
- Encoding checks have been removed because they can either be done using `:field_transform` or outside the library
- Better docs

### Upgrading from 2.x
- **Parallelism has been removed**, alongside its options `:num_workers` and `:worker_work_ratio`. You can safely remove them.
- **`StrayQuoteError` is now `StrayEscapeCharacterError`**. If you catch this error in your code, you need to rename it.
- **The `:strip_fields` option needs to be replaced** with the `:field_transform` option:
  ```elixir
  File.stream!("data.csv") |> CSV.decode(field_transform: &String.trim/1)
  ```
- **`:validate_row_length` now defaults to `false`**. This option produces an error for rows with different length. Set it
  to `true` to get the same behaviour as in 2.x
- **`:escape_formulas` is now `:unescape_formulas` for `decode` and `decode!`.** It is still `:escape_formulas` for
  `encode`. Change `:escape_formulas` to `:unescape_formulas` in `decode` calls to get the same behaviour as in 2.x
- **`:escape_max_lines` now defaults to `10`** instead of `1000`. To get the same behaviour as in 2.x, use:
  ```elixir
  File.stream!("data.csv") |> CSV.decode(escape_max_lines: 1000)
  ```
- **`:replace` has been removed**. `CSV` will now return fields with incorrect encoding as-is. 
  You can use the new `:field_transform` option to provide a function transforming fields while they are being parsed. 
  This allows to e.g. replace incorrect encoding:
  ```elixir
  defp replace_bad_encoding(field) do
    if String.valid?(field) do
      field
    else
      field
      |> String.codepoints()
      |> Enum.map(fn codepoint -> if String.valid?(codepoint), do: codepoint, else: "?" end)
      |> Enum.join()
    end
  end
  ```
