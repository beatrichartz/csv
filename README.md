# CSV [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beatrichartz/csv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beatrichartz/csv) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/beatrichartz/csv/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/beatrichartz/csv?branch=master) [![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/beatrichartz/csv.svg?branch=master)](http://inch-ci.org/github/beatrichartz/csv)
[RFC 4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) compliant CSV parsing and encoding for Elixir. Allows to specify other separators, so it could also be named: TSV. Why it is not idk, because of defaults I think.

## Why do we want it?

It parses files which contain rows (in utf-8) separated by either commas or
other separators.

If that's not enough reason to absolutely :heart: :green_heart: :two_hearts: :heart: :revolving_hearts: :sparkling_heart: it,
it also parses a CSV file in order about 2x times as fast as an unparallelized
stream implementation :rocket:

## When do we want it?

Now.

## How do I get it?

Add
```elixir
{:csv, "~> 1.4.0"}
```
to your deps in `mix.exs` like so:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:csv, "~> 1.4.0"}
  ]
end
```

Note: Elixir `1.1.0` is required for all versions above `1.1.5`.

## Great! How do I use it right now?

Do this to decode:

````elixir
File.stream!("data.csv") |> CSV.decode
````

And you'll get a stream of rows. So, this is upcasing the text in each cell of
a tab separated file because someone is angry:

````elixir
File.stream!("data.csv") |>
CSV.decode(separator: ?\t) |>
Enum.map(fn row ->
  Enum.map(row, &String.upcase/1)
end)
````

### Decoding as a Map
Given a `csv` with headers like this

**data.csv**
```
a,b,c
1,2,3
4,5,6
...
```

using `CSV.decode_as_map` you can decode the file as a stream of maps using the header. The following lines
```elixir
File.stream!("data.csv") |> CSV.decode_as_map
```
create a stream of maps with the header as atom keys like this
```
{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
{a: 4, b: 5, c: 6}
...
```

## Encoding 
Do this to encode a table (two-dimensional list):

````elixir
table_data |> CSV.encode
````

And you'll get a stream of lines ready to be written to an IO.
So, this is writing to a file:

````elixir
file = File.open!("test.csv", [:write])
table_data |> CSV.encode |> Enum.each(&IO.write(file, &1))
````

## I have this file, but it's tab-separated :interrobang:

Pass in another separator to the decoder:

````elixir
File.stream!("data.csv") |> CSV.decode(separator: ?\t)
````

If you want to take revenge on whoever did this to you, encode with semicolons
like this:

````elixir
your_data |> CSV.encode(separator: ?;)
````

You can also specify headers when encoding, which will encode map values into
the right place:

````elixir
[%{"a" => "value!"}] |> CSV.encode(headers: ["z", "a"])
# ["z,a\\r\\n", ",value!\\r\\n"]
````

## Polymorphic encoding

Make sure your data gets encoded the way you want - implement the `CSV.Encode`
protocol for whatever strange you wish to encode:

````elixir
defimpl CSV.Encode, for: MyData do
  def encode(%MyData{has: fun}, env \\ []) do
    "so much #{fun}" |> CSV.Encode.encode(env)
  end
end
````

Or similar.

## Ensure performant encoding

The encoding protocol implements a fallback to Any for types where a simple call
o `to_string` will provide unambiguous results. Protocol dispatch for the
fallback to Any is *very* slow when protocols are not consolidated, so make sure
you [have `consolidate_protocols: true`](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/04/build-embedded-and-start-permanent-in-elixir-1-0-4/)
in your `mix.exs` or you consolidate protocols manually for production in order
to get good performance.
