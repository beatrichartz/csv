[RFC 4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) compliant CSV parsing and encoding for Elixir. Allows to specify other separators, so it could also be named: TSV. Why it is not idk, because of defaults I think.

## Why do we want it?

It parses files which contain rows (in utf-8) separated by either commas or
other separators.

If that's not enough reason to absolutely :heart: :green_heart: :two_hearts: :heart: :revolving_hearts: :sparkling_heart: it,
it also parses a CSV file in order about 2x times as fast as an unparallelized
stream implementation :rocket:

## When do we want it?

Now.

## How do I get it?

Add
```elixir
{:csv, "~> 2.4"}
```
to your deps in `mix.exs` like so:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:csv, "~> 2.4"}
  ]
end
```

> Note: Elixir `1.1.0` is required for all versions above `1.1.5`.

### From 1.x to 2.x - the tasty :tm: update.

2.x has some nice new features like the separation between hair- and error-raising
[`decode!`](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.html#decode!/2) and the zen of
[`decode`](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.html#decode!/2), better error messages
and an easier to understand codebase
[for you to contribute](https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv#contributions--bugfixes-are-most-welcome).

The only thing you _have_ to do to upgrade to 2.x is to change your calls to
`decode` to [`decode!`](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.html#decode!/2),
and adjust your exceptions-catching code to catch the
[right exceptions](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/overview.html#exceptions_summary)
still. But why not take full advantage and convert to
[`decode` and the new tuple stream?](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.html#decode/2)

You know you want it.

## Great! How do I use it right now?

There are two interesting things you want to do regarding csvs - 
encoding end decoding.

### Decoding

Do this to decode:

````elixir
File.stream!("data.csv") |> CSV.decode
````

And you'll get a stream of row tuples:
````elixir
[ok: ["a", "b"], ok: ["c", "d"]]
````

And, potentially error tuples:
````elixir
[error: "Row has length 3 - expected length 2 on line 1", ok: ["c", "d"]]
````

Use the bang to decode! into a two-dimensional list, raising errors as they
occur:
````elixir
File.stream!("data.csv") |> CSV.decode!
````

Be sure to [read more about `decode`](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.html#decode/2)
and [its angry sibling `decode!`](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.html#decode!/2)

### Encoding

Do this to encode a table (two-dimensional list):

````elixir
table_data |> CSV.encode
````

And you'll get a stream of lines ready to be written to an IO.
So, this is writing to a file:

````elixir
file = File.open!("test.csv", [:write, :utf8])
table_data |> CSV.encode |> Enum.each(&IO.write(file, &1))
````

## I have this file, but it's tab-separated :interrobang:

Pass in another separator to the decoder:

````elixir
File.stream!("data.csv") |> CSV.decode(separator: ?\t)
````

If you want to take revenge on whoever did this to you, encode with semicolons
like this:

````elixir
your_data |> CSV.encode(separator: ?;)
````

You can also specify headers when encoding, which will encode map values into
the right place:

````elixir
[%{"a" => "value!"}] |> CSV.encode(headers: ["z", "a"])
# ["z,a\\r\\n", ",value!\\r\\n"]
````

You'll surely appreciate some [more info on `encode`](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/CSV.html#encode/2)

## Polymorphic encoding

Make sure your data gets encoded the way you want - implement the `CSV.Encode`
protocol for whatever strange you wish to encode:

````elixir
defimpl CSV.Encode, for: MyData do
  def encode(%MyData{has: fun}, env \\ []) do
    "so much #{fun}" |> CSV.Encode.encode(env)
  end
end
````

Or similar.

## Ensure performant encoding

The encoding protocol implements a fallback to Any for types where a simple call
o `to_string` will provide unambiguous results. Protocol dispatch for the
fallback to Any is *very* slow when protocols are not consolidated, so make sure
you [have `consolidate_protocols: true`](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/04/build-embedded-and-start-permanent-in-elixir-1-0-4/)
in your `mix.exs` or you consolidate protocols manually for production in order
to get good performance.

## Contributions & Bugfixes are most welcome!
Please make sure to add tests. I will not look at PRs that are
either failing or lowering coverage. Also, solve one problem at
a time.
